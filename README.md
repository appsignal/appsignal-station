# AppSignal Station ðŸš‚

## Chooo choo, welcome to the coding assignment
You're invited to do a short coding task as part of your interviewing process at AppSignal. 

### General information
- You should take between 60-90 minutes to work on this, after you've set up the project.
- Please don't spend more time on this, in the spirit of fairness.
- You'll get a gift card of $50 in return for your time. We do this because we want to be mindful of your time spend on this. 
- Alternatively, we can donate $50 to an open-source project of your choice.

### Guidelines
- We'll judge you the following criteria
  - Does it work?
  - Code clarity
  - Code qualtiy
  - Chosen patterns and solutions
  - Progress made
  - Your explanation of the code in the follow-up call
- Some tips to make this work smoothly
  - Write comments in your code
  - Make commits
  - Think about naming things 
  - Keep a some notes on what you found easy/hard
  - If you're unfamiliar with Jest or TailwindCSS, feel free to switch to something you're familiar with!

## The actual assignment
In this asignment, you'll use an open GraphQL API to build a small project in NextJS. We picked an API from the Deutsche Bahn that gives back information about train stations.

### What we prepared
- We created a HelloWorld component
- We created a page where at least one graphQL query is performed

### What you need to build
- [ ] An index page where you can search for stations
- [ ] Return the stations as cards and show some information about the station
- [ ] An empty state if no stations can be found
- [ ] Tests for the features with Jest
- [ ] Add some minimal styling with TailwindCSS

## Handing in the assignment
- Create a cloned version of the repository
- Invite @wesoudshoorn @jvanbaarsen @matsimitsu as collaborators
- Email Wes Oudshoorn when the assignment is done
- Plan a follow-up call with the link in your coding-interview invite email
## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the api used.

## API's used

We are using the DeutsheBahn graphQL API, a playground for this can be found  here: https://bahnql.herokuapp.com/graphql. 

## Tools used / installed

* Jest / React Testing Library
* TailwindCSS
